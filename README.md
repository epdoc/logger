# @epdoc/logger

A logging module supporting built-in and custom transports, webserver response middleware, message and data syntax
with color console output, chainable methods for recording log events, many of which can be chained to create richer output with more columns of data.

## Versions

**Version 1000.0.0 indicates a major rewrite that is incompatible with prior versions of this module**


# Install

```bash
deno add @epdoc/logger
```

# Quick Start

```typescript
import { Log } from '@epdoc/logger';

// Define the type for the message builder we want to use.
// In this case, we are using the built-in Console message builder.
type M = Log.MsgBuilder.Console.Builder;
type L = Log.Std.Logger<M>;

// Create a new Log Manager instance.
const logMgr = new Log.Mgr<M>();

// Get a logger instance from the manager.
const log = logMgr.getLogger<L>();

// Set the logging threshold.
logMgr.threshold = 'verbose';

// Show the log level in the output
logMgr.show = { level: true };

// --- Example Usage ---
log.info.section('Start simple.ts std logger').emit();

// A simple log message.
log.info.h2('Hello world').emit();
```

# Why Another Logger?

I use logging extensively to

- trace proper executing of my code and also to
- enhance CLI applications with detailed output

None of the existing loggers that I could find supported the following requirements:

- easy colorization using chaninable methods
- ability to customize log levels to my own liking
- ability to extend existing classes with my own functionality (most modules default to making code private rather than
  protected)
- middleware to support backend server display of reqId, session ID so that log messaages could be filtered by request
  ID.
- custom transports:
  - at various points I have had transports for [Loggly](http://loggly.com) and SOS (a defunct desktop log display
    application)
  - external transports requires open and close support, or equivalent.
- JSON, JSON array and console text output all supported

## Action Items

- Verify middleware implementations, especially for express
- Revive old SOS transport as a general HTTP transport and rename to 'http' transport (beware).
