/**
 * Implements a logger with a standard set of log levels.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This logger provides the following common log levels:
 * - `error`: For critical, usually non-recoverable issues.
 * - `warn`: For potential problems that don't halt execution.
 * - `info`: For general informational messages.
 * - `verbose`: For more detailed information than `info`, often for debugging.
 * - `debug`: For detailed diagnostic information, typically for developers.
 * - `trace`: For fine-grained tracing of program execution.
 * - `spam`: An additional level for very verbose, often temporary, debugging output.
 *
 * This class extends {@link Logger.Indent} to provide indentation capabilities
 * and implements {@link std.IStdLogger} and {@link Logger.IEmitter} for its core
 * logging functionality.
 *
 * @template M - The type of message builder used by the logger.
